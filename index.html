      <h3>Use Apple Intelligence in Messages on iPhone</h3>
      <p>Apple Intelligence* allows you to get through your messages even faster with summaries that show you the key points of each conversation, and Smart Reply, which helps you quickly craft a response.</p>
      <p>Note: Apple Intelligence is available in iOS 18.1 or later on all iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. To check whether Apple Intelligence is available for your device and language, see the Apple Support article Apple Intelligence requirements.</p>
      <h3>Turn message summaries on or off</h3>
      <p>When you turn on Apple Intelligence, summaries automatically appear under your message conversations. You can turn off summaries if you want to see the most recent message in each conversation instead.</p>

      <p>If Siri doesn’t find what you asked for, be more specific. For example, say “Play the radio station ‘Pure Pop’” rather than saying “Play ‘Pure Pop.’”</p>
