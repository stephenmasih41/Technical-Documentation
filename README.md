Python Documentation Project:- 

Description:- 
This project is my 3rd project towards earning my Web Development Certification. The project is a Python Documentation Page built using HTML and CSS to demonstrate responsive design, clean structuring, and the use of semantic elements.

Project Purpose:- 

The aim of this project was to:

Showcase my understanding of semantic HTML for documentation layout.
Implement navigation links to internal sections for a single-page application.
Use a consistent, readable design for presenting Python concepts.

This documentation page is designed to educate beginners on the following Python topics:

What is Python?
Variables
Variable Names
Multiple Variables
Data Types
Each section includes textual descriptions, examples, and properly formatted code snippets.

Features:- 

Sticky Navigation Bar: The navigation bar stays fixed at the top for easy access to all sections.
Semantic Structure: All major sections are structured using semantic HTML5 elements. Each section has a unique id corresponding to its navigation link for smooth internal navigation.
Code Formatting: All Python examples are displayed using the 'Code' tag for clear, monospaced formatting.
Responsive Design: The page structure is clean and adapts well to different screen sizes.

Technologies Used:- 

HTML5: For structuring the content and adding semantics.
CSS3: For basic styling and layout.

Project Goals Achieved:- 
Created a single-page documentation layout.
Properly structured HTML using navigation, sections, and headings.
Learned and applied ID-based navigation for quick access to sections.
This project highlights the key concepts of working with Python while solidifying my knowledge of HTML and basic styling in CSS.
